Classic technic Game for Minetest engine
==========================================================

Warning: I lost interest in Minetest, so this project is on hold.
it should be functional and because its targeted to old version of MT,
there is minimal chance that devs break anything.

This game is inspired by technic game, but with older more challenging
recipes, with lot of additions, some deletions and changes at all.

This game contains more than 4000 blocks so you need 0.4.7 git server.
(atleast from 1. Nov 2013)

Cloning with git:
	This repository uses submodules. In order to get all the parts of the
	game you will need to run 'git submodule update --init' when you clone
	and 'git submodule update' every time that the submodules are updated.
